# Gif generator
I wrote this tool to generate gifs for Discord servers

## Usage
Make `index.mjs` executable. On linux I used `chmod +x index.mjs`. Then run `./index.mjs -f input.gif -t "your message" -o out.gif` (fill the parameters in with whatever you need).

That's all you need to generate a gif!

Also, you'll need ffmpeg installed.
